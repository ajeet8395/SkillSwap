## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

SkillSwap is a web application where users can offer their expertise in a particular skill (e.g., guitar lessons, coding, photography) in exchange for learning a skill from others (e.g., cooking, painting). This platform will allow users to create profiles, post their available skills, request skills they want to learn, and connect with other users for skill exchange. A rating and review system ensures the credibility and quality of the users' services.

*************************************************************************************
Approach to Development:
1. Set Up the MERN Stack:
   - Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
   - Backend: Node.js and Express.js for API development.
   - Database: MongoDB for storing user data, skill listings, reviews, etc.
   - State Management: Use Redux Toolkit for efficient global state management, particularly for authentication, user data, and skill listings.
   - User Authentication (JWT-Based):


2. User Authentication (JWT-Based):
   - Implement secure user registration and login using JWT tokens.
   - Add social login options via Google, Facebook, and GitHub APIs for convenience.
   - Skill Listings & Requests:


3. Skill Listings & Requests:
   - Create a feature that allows users to post the skills they are offering and request the skills they want to learn.
   - Implement forms for posting these skills and searching for other users.
   - Users should be able to view details of other users' skills and send requests.
   - Rating & Reviews System:

4. Rating & Reviews System:
   - After a skill exchange, users should have the option to leave a review.
   - Implement a rating feature with stars or a numerical scale, with feedback visible on users' profiles.
   - Messaging Feature:


5. Messaging Feature:
   - Create a basic messaging system where users can chat in real-time to finalize the details of their skill exchange.
   - Use libraries like Socket.IO to build the chat feature.
   - Admin Dashboard:


6. Admin Dashboard:
   - Implement an admin panel for monitoring and managing the platform.
   - Admins should be able to ban users, remove inappropriate listings, and resolve disputes.
   - Testing & Deployment:

7. Testing & Deployment:
   - Test the application thoroughly for both frontend and backend.
   - Deploy the frontend on Vercel or Netlify and the backend on platforms like Heroku.






*************************************************************************************


Detailed Breakdown:
1. Frontend:
   - Build reusable components (e.g., profile card, skill listing card, chat window).
   - Use Tailwind CSS for easy styling and responsiveness.
   - Pages:
          - Landing Page: Introduction, benefits, and call to action (sign up/log in).
          - Profile Page: User information, skills offered, skills needed, reviews.
          - Skill Listings Page: Browse or search for skills with filters.
          - Requests Page: Show skill swap requests (incoming and outgoing).
          - Messaging: Chat or direct messaging between users.



2. Backend:
   - Create RESTful APIs for users, skill listings, requests, and reviews.
   - Implement CRUD operations for users, skill listings, and ratings.
   - Protect routes using authentication and authorization middleware (JWT).



3. Database Structure (MongoDB):
   - Users Collection:(json)
     {
       "_id": "userId",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "skillsOffered": ["Guitar", "Photography"],
       "skillsNeeded": ["Cooking", "Web Design"],
       "bio": "Short description...",
       "reviews": [{ "reviewer": "userId", "rating": 5, "comment": "Great experience!" }],
       "profilePicture": "url",
       "location": "New York, NY"
     }



    - Skill Requests Collection:(json)
       {
         "_id": "requestId",
         "requester": "userId",
         "skillOffered": "Guitar",
         "skillRequested": "Cooking",
         "status": "Pending", // (Accepted, Declined)
         "messages": [
           {
             "sender": "userId",
             "message": "I'd love to swap guitar lessons for cooking classes."
           }
         ]
       }




***********Additional Ideas:**********
 - Skill Categories & Tags: Add categories like "Art," "Music," "Tech," "Languages" to help users find relevant skills quickly.
 - Scheduling & Calendar Integration: Allow users to book sessions and integrate with Google Calendar for scheduling.
 - Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the app is fully responsive and mobile-friendly to make it accessible to users on any device.
